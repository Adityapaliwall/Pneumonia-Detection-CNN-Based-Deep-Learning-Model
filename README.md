# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection using CNN
A deep learning–based image classification project that detects Pneumonia from Chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project demonstrates the use of medical image preprocessing, CNN architecture design, and model evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras.


This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect **Pneumonia** from **chest X-ray images**. The goal is to assist in early medical diagnosis by automatically classifying X-ray images into **Normal** or **Pneumonia** categories.  
The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and demonstrates strong performance in medical image classification tasks.

## 📘 Project Description

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection, and early detection is critical. Manual examination of X-rays can be time-consuming and prone to human error.  
This deep learning project provides an automated solution by:

- Preprocessing chest X-ray images  
- Training a CNN model to extract visual patterns  
- Classifying images as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**  

This model serves as a foundation for future AI-based diagnostic tools in healthcare.
